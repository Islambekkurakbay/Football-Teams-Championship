# Football-Teams-Championship
Bonus Task given by Professor on the course of Algorithms and Data Structures at my university.





Football league with 20 teams:
•	Team 1 (Alfa team, Students, Jokers, Tigers, etc – the names are up to you, can be even generated randomly) 
•	Team 2
•	Team 3 
… 
•	Team 20


Your task is to generate all results for each week, the everyweek table and the final table. All results are generated randomly, the final table is generated based on the results. All teams play 38 weeks, each week by 1 game only. The result of each game should be no more than 10 goals in one game, for example 5-5 is OK, 9-1 is OK, and 10-10 is not OK. Depending on the results of each week, the final table (scoreboard) must be generated. Each team must play with the other teams twice, once at home arena, and the second time away. The first team named in the result means that it plays at home arena. In case if the team wins, it gets 3 points, if draw 1 point, and if loses – 0 points. 

Example of the first week plays: 
•	Team 1 – Team 2:  1-1 
•	Team 3 – Team 4: 1-1 
•	Team 5 – Team 6: 1-1 
•	Team 7 – Team 8: 1-1 
•	Team 9 – Team 10: 1-1 
•	Team 11 – Team 12: 1-1 
•	Team 13 – Team 14: 1-1 
•	Team 15 – Team 16: 1-1 
•	Team 17 – Team 18: 3-1 
•	Team 19 – Team 20: 1-1
 
Table after Week 1:
The table must be formed based on the following template: 
Team name, Number of wins, Number of draws, Number of loses, Number of scored goals, Number of goals conceded, Total points. 
1.	Team 17: 1 (1 win), 0 (0 draws), 0 (0 loses), 3 (3 points)
2.	Team 1: 0 (0 win), 1 (1 draw), 0 (0 loses), 1 (1 point) 
3.	Team 2
4.	Team 3
5.	…
6.	Team 20
7.	Team 18: 0 wins, 0 draws, 1 lose, 0 points
